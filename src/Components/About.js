              I hold a Bachelor of Computer Science in Software Engineering and
              have 2 years of experience developing and maintaining software
              applications. My primary focus has been on server-side
              development, and I am eager to apply my skills to full-stack
              development. During my career, I have refined my backend
              development skills, including implementing and maintaining
              scalable server-side solutions. My passion for growth and learning
              led me to complete the Full Stack Developer Program sponsored by
              Yayasan Pahang, further expanding my expertise in full-stack
              development
